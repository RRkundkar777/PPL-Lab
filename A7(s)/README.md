# About
This Assignment demonstrates exception handling, raising an exception, using the try-except and raise statements.

## What is an Exception
Definition: An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
Errors are one of Exceptions.

## Why Raise Exception
```
Let us say your program takes an input from user.
It then processes the input to give an Output.
Now suppose the processing time is 30minutes and the user enters an invalid input.
Neither you nor the user will expect to wait for 30 minutes and get an error.
You would expect the program to give an error as soon as it receives an invalid input.
Thats being able to raise Exceptions is important
```

## Exception Handling
```
There are situations where there is probablity that the program might give error but you want the rest of code to be executed.
Normally when a program encounters an error, it collapses and does not further
But this thing can be avoided by handling the error/Exception
```
