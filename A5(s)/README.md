# About
This assignment is all about the object oriented programming in Python

In this assignment, the class constructor, destructor, access specifiers, the objects of a class, the object variables, getters and setters have been described.

## Class Constructor
A class constructor is a function which creates a class object.

## Class Destructor
Destructors in C++  are used to de-allocate the memory that has been allocated for the object by the constructor.

In Python, destructors are not needed as much needed in C++ because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically.

But we can modify the destructor function using dunder method __del__ to print when the object gets destroyed

## Getters and Setters 

As the name suggests, getters are the methods which help access the private attributes or get the value of the private attributes and setters are the methods which help change or set the value of private attributes.

Getters and setters are not special methods in Python as they are in Java. We can define functions get() and set() to achive this.

## Access Specifiers

Access specifiers are used to modify the accessibily of Variables in Python Classes
