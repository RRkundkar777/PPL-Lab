A-1 Declarations, Expressions, and Assignments
----------------------------------------------

        Compile the following program (file  A-1.c) and observe the GIMPLE dumps
        and answer  the questions below. If  you manage to finish  all questions
        quickly try to attempt the optional problem.

        Source file : A-1.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple A-1.c
        View result : vi -O A-1.c A-1.c.*.gimple
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-1.c.* A-1.o

Program
-------

	int Z;

	void main()
	{
		int a, b, c;
		int p = 6;
		int q;
		double r;

		a = 10;
		b = 20;
		c = a * b + 25;
		p = 6;
		q = Z;
		r = 34.5;
		Z = r;
		Z = Z + 1;
	}


Questions with Answers
---------

        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
            Ans : The declarations in gimple are are done one at a time.
            All the variables are declared and assigned a type first. 
            Then the variables are initialized in the same order as they are 
            initialized in the source file. Again one declaration at a time.
            The global declaration int Z has disappeared.

        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
             Ans : The complex expressions are broken down into simple expressions
             by inserting temporary variables. These simple expressions appear as single statements
            These variables are introduced whenever expressions containing
            more than one operators are encountered or when typecasting is done.
            
        3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
             Ans : Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation.
            When floats and doubles are assigned to integer, then an intermediate
            variable is created which is explicitly typecasted into an integer.
            Then the intermediate integer is assigned to Z.

        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
             Ans : The reads/writes to Z are performed in the same
            way as other variables except when it comes to the expression Z = Z+1.
            When an expression Z = Z+1 comes into picture, the value inside Z is modified
            and cannot be written directly to Z. Therefore the initial value of Z is stored inside
            another variable and then it is modified.

            
Optional Problem
----------------

        Try to understand the underlying GIMPLE representation by looking at the
        RAW dumps:

        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple-raw A-1.c
        View result : vi -O A-1.c A-1.c.*.gimple
